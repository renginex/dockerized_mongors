# Dockerized MongoDB Replica Set
Here is an example how to stand up a dockerized MongoDB replica set with authentication. You can easily just run the mongors.sh shell script to get it online. Just change the variable values to what you need them to be, run the script, and you'll have secure, dockerized MongoDB replica set up in just a few minutes!

The only things you'll need to have installed are Docker and docker-compose.
